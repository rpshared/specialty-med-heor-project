# Specialty Meds Web App

A minimal, static, desktop-first web application that displays specialty / rare / orphan medications
using a dropdown selector and a clean info card UI. Data is powered by a Google Sheet published as CSV.

This project was built as a portfolio artifact to demonstrate:
- Real-world data (RWD) and PRO awareness in specialty pharmacy
- Simple, transparent front-end engineering (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS)
- Lightweight, serverless architecture with Google Sheets as backend
- Good project organization and use of AI as a coding assistant

## Live Demo

(Will be added after GitHub Pages is set up and verified)
